# ☕ Desk-Bench Café

**Desk-Bench Café** is a responsive, visually immersive coffee shop website designed and developed to bring the cozy, upscale café experience to the digital space.  
This project marks my first complete journey — from a visual concept to a fully coded, interactive, and responsive web experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal was to translate the café’s **brand identity** into a clear, intuitive, and elegant digital interface — blending aesthetics, usability, and responsiveness.  
The site showcases the menu, booking options, and seamless ordering through third-party services like **Swiggy** and **Zomato**, while maintaining a consistent design language across all devices.
